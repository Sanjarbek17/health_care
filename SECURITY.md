# Security Checklist for Health Care Flutter App

## âœ… Implemented Security Measures

### 1. **Environment Variables** âœ…
- [x] Added `flutter_dotenv` package for environment variable management
- [x] Created `.env` file for sensitive configuration
- [x] Added `.env*` files to `.gitignore` to prevent committing secrets
- [x] Created `.env.example` template for team members

### 2. **API Key Security** âœ…
- [x] Removed hardcoded OpenAI API key from source code
- [x] Implemented secure loading of API keys from environment variables
- [x] Added validation to ensure API keys are properly configured
- [x] Created utility class `ApiConfig` for centralized key management

### 3. **Error Handling** âœ…
- [x] Added proper error handling for missing API keys
- [x] Implemented user-friendly error messages in UI
- [x] Added timeout configuration (30 seconds) for API requests
- [x] Added error handling for network failures

### 4. **Code Quality** âœ…
- [x] Added input validation before sending messages
- [x] Implemented null safety checks throughout the code
- [x] Added loading states and proper UI feedback

## ðŸ”’ Additional Security Recommendations

### 1. **API Key Rotation**
- [ ] Regularly rotate your OpenAI API keys (monthly/quarterly)
- [ ] Monitor API usage for suspicious activity
- [ ] Set up usage limits on your OpenAI account

### 2. **Network Security**
- [ ] Consider implementing certificate pinning for production
- [ ] Add request/response logging only in debug mode
- [ ] Implement request rate limiting to prevent abuse

### 3. **User Input Validation**
- [ ] Add input sanitization for user messages
- [ ] Implement content filtering for inappropriate content
- [ ] Add message length limits

### 4. **Production Considerations**
- [ ] Use different API keys for development and production
- [ ] Implement proper logging and monitoring
- [ ] Add crash reporting (Firebase Crashlytics)
- [ ] Consider using a backend proxy instead of direct API calls

### 5. **Firebase Security**
- [ ] Review Firebase security rules
- [ ] Implement proper user authentication
- [ ] Use Firebase App Check for additional security

## ðŸš¨ Critical Security Notes

1. **Never commit secrets**: Always double-check that no API keys or sensitive data are in your commits
2. **Environment separation**: Use different keys/configurations for dev, staging, and production
3. **Access control**: Limit who has access to production API keys
4. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for unusual API usage patterns
5. **Updates**: Keep all dependencies updated to patch security vulnerabilities

## ðŸ“‹ Pre-deployment Checklist

- [ ] All API keys are in environment variables
- [ ] `.env` file is not committed to version control
- [ ] Error handling is implemented for all API calls
- [ ] Input validation is in place
- [ ] Logging is configured appropriately for production
- [ ] Security testing has been performed
